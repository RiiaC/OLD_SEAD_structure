Records detailed information about each excavation or sampling location i.e. a defined location where samples have been collected through excavation.

> [!info] to add somewhere
> Each site can have multiple national identifiers of different types. Many sites will have a Lämningsnummer and an RAÄ-nr. The RAÄ-nr must _always_ a combination of the Socken and number (so concatenate the fields on import). Each identifier should go into a separate record (not with ; in the same field)
