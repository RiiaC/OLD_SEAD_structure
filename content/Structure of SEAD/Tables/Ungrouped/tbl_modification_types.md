| modification_type_id | modification_type_name           | modification_type_description                                                                                       |

| 1                    | Carbonised                       | Organic matter converted to carbon, most commonly though heating.                                                   |
| 2                    | Calcified                        | Organic matter replaced by calcium                                                                                  |
| 3                    | Eroded                           | Surface of fossil has been worn away by physical processes, such as sediment abbraision.                            |
| 4                    | Fragmented                       | Fossil is not whole.                                                                                                |
| 5                    | Mineralised (unspecific)         | Organic matter replaced by unspecified mineral(s).                                                                  |
| 6                    | Pyritified                       | Organic matter replaced by pyrite or marcasite.                                                                     |
| 7                    | Discoloured (more than expected) | Expected colour of fossil, considering preservation factors, is of an unexpected colour. E.g. as a result of dying. |
| 8                    | Petrified                        | Organic matter converted to stone by impregnation with silica.                                                      |
| 9                    | Encased in amber                 | Fossil is encapsulated in a piece of amber.                                                                         |
| 10                   | Corroded                         | Surface of fossil has been damage by chemical processes.                                                            |
