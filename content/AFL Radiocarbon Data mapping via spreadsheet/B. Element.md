> [!info] Element refers to the types of things that were analysed for the dataset.
> In this dataset the radiocarbon analyses were performed on bones, and this column specifies which type of bones were analysed (e.g. Femur, Mandibula, Humerus, etc.).

# abundance elements
- [ ] create and fill in a sheet called **abundance_elements**  in the  [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd))  spreadsheet with the following columns
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.
- **[[abundance_element_id]]** This will be the unique ide associated with each **element_name**, as these are all new element_names in SEAD, they need to be assigned a number in the system
- **[[record_type_id]]** as these analyses were all performed on animal bones, use record_type_id =14, which is the value already in SEAD for animal bones.
- **[[element_name]]** This is where each unique value from this column will be entered. As this will be the first SEAD dataset to report analyses of bones, all of these are new element names:
1. Cranium 
2. Femur 
3. Fibula 
4. Humerus 
5. Mandibula 
6. nd 
7. Occipitale 
8. Phalanx 
9. Radius 
10. Scapula 
11. Temporal 
12. Vertebra 
- **[[element_description]]** As these are all new element types for SEAD, ask the researcher to provide a description to go with each of these element names which will help non-specialists understand what each term means
# abundances
> [!tips]+ we must also record the actual abundance and information relating to each element in the dataset
- [ ] create and fill in a sheet called **abundances**  in the  [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd))  spreadsheet with the following columns
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.
- **[[taxon_id]]** This specifies the taxonomic unit related to this record, where **taxon_id = 1 = sp.**, and is the value assumed for this data set when the initial mapping was done.
- **[[analysis_entity_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the **tbl_analysis_entities** sheet of this spreadsheet (see below)
- **[[abundance_element_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the above mentioned **abundance_elements** sheet. (If it helps to keep track of which ones have been done, you can also add a column to show the corresponding **element_name** on this sheet, but it is not needed for the import process, this column is enough to connect the information for the relational part of the database.)
# analysis entities
> [!tips]+ Each element has experienced one or more types of analysis that led to the dataset which we need to define
- [ ] create and fill in a sheet called  **tbl_analysis_entities**  in the  [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd))  spreadsheet with the following columns
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.

- **[[physical_sample_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the **physical samples** sheet (see the note for E. Lab nr). (If it helps to keep track of which ones have been done, you can also add a column to show the corresponding **sample_name** on this sheet, but it is not needed for the import process, this column is enough to connect the information for the relational part of the database.)
- **[[dataset_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the **datasets** sheet (see the note for **0. Datset**).

- **[[abundance**]]
