The below tables show various categories of information that can be imported into SEAD. Some of these lists have been extracted from templates developed at [Umeå Environmental Archaeology Laboratory, MAL](https://www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/mal/) for some of their standard data types to be imported into SEAD. Excel versions of these template files are available on request.

For all of the below tables, the required data is in **bold print**, optional data is in regular print. Note: the below table and column descriptions are modified from the corresponding descriptions on https://humlab-sead.github.io/sead-schema/index.html unless otherwise specified.

# Site
All data in SEAD must be associated with a specific named site, with a recorded latitude and longitude. It is possible to record additional information about the site and location, including:

| Column name     | Description                                                                                                                                   |

# Features
When samples are associated with a specific archaeological feature that information can be recorded in SEAD:

| Column name  | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Name | Name or identifier assigned to the archaeological feature, as used in field documentation or project records.                                                              |
| Feature Type | Classification of the feature based on form or function (e.g. hearth, pit, posthole, ditch), following project or standard archaeological terminology.                     |
| Description  | Free‑text description of the feature, summarising observed characteristics such as morphology, composition, dimensions, stratigraphic relationships, and notable contents. |
# Sample Group
The sample group is a required category for SEAD because it is the level to which many of the other tables are attached. It contains collections of related samples, typically grouped by structures (e.g., House 1), stratigraphic sequences (e.g., profile 3), or lake cores. It could also refer to a collection of bones from a single skeleton. Groups can be defined flexibly based on research needs. In the case of isolated single samples, they still need to be assigned to a sample group, but in those cases the group contains only one sample.

| Column name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sample group name**    | **A unique identifier name for the sample group. (For ceramics, this should be the vessel number.)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Type                     | This table categorizes the types of descriptions related to sample groups. It includes types such as architectural data (e.g., roof type, structural details) or dendrochronological anlabels related to shipwrecks. Note that these descriptions are intended to provide context and should not be used to infer specific features of the samples. Users can add custom lookup data. |
| Publication              | Contains bibliographic information specifically relevant to a sample group, distinct from site or dataset references (e.g., a publication that reinterprets a structure within a site).                                                                                                                                                                                               |

# Physical Samples
This table records information about physical samples collected from specific sites. Each sample is characterised by its location within the site, its physical properties measured in specific units (e.g., liters, kilograms), and its context within its sample group. Additionally, samples may have descriptive information, notes, and external identifiers linked to other systems.

# Soil Chemistry: Geochemical, Physical, and Sediment Properties
This section documents laboratory measurements of sediment and soil properties, including phosphorus fractions, magnetic susceptibility, loss‑on‑ignition, pH, electrical conductivity, and grain size distribution. Together, these variables characterise the chemical composition, physical structure, and depositional or anthropogenic influences affecting the sampled material.

# Archaeobotany: Taxonomic and Anatomical Identification (Faunal Remains)
This section records taxonomic and anatomical identifications of faunal remains, including genus-, species-, and subspecies‑level determinations, along with uncertainty qualifiers. It also documents observed modifications and anatomical elements, providing information relevant to species representation, taphonomy, and human or natural processes affecting the remains.

|columnn name|description|
|---|---|
|Genus uncertainty|Indicator describing uncertainty or qualification associated with the genus‑level identification (e.g. cf., aff., ?, probable), as defined by laboratory or project conventions.|
|Genus|Genus to which the specimen is assigned, based on morphological identification.|
|Species uncertainty|Indicator describing uncertainty or qualification associated with the species‑level identification (e.g. cf., aff., ?, probable), as defined by laboratory or project conventions.|
|Species|Species epithet assigned to the specimen, where identification beyond genus is possible.|
|Subspecies|Subspecies designation, where applicable and identifiable, following standard zoological nomenclature.|
|Modifications|Observed modifications to the specimen indicating natural or anthropogenic alteration, such as cut marks, burning, gnawing, weathering, fragmentation, or other taphonomic features.|
|Element|Anatomical element represented by the specimen (e.g. femur, humerus, mandible, vertebra, scale), following zooarchaeological anatomical terminology.|

# Other Macro remains by type (Charcoal, Bone, Ceramics, and Other Materials)
This section documents the presence or quantity of selected macroscopic remains recovered from samples, including charcoal, bone, ceramics, and other visible materials. These data capture coarse archaeological and environmental evidence obtained through visual sorting and provide contextual information on site formation and material deposition.

|columnn name|description|
|---|---|
|MAL nr|Unique laboratory number assigned by the Umeå Environmental Archaeology Laboratory (MAL) to the sample or analytical unit.|
|Träkol|Recorded quantity or presence of charcoal (wood charcoal) macro‑remains identified in the sample.|
|Ben|Recorded quantity or presence of bone macro‑remains identified in the sample.|
|Keramik|Recorded quantity or presence of ceramic (pottery) fragments identified in the sample.|
|Annat|Recorded quantity or presence of other macro‑remains not covered by the predefined categories (e.g. slag, shell, daub, unidentified material), as defined by the analyst.|
