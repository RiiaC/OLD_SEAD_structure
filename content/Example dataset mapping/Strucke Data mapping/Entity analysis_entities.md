- [x] create the data-derived analysis_entities and select `labn_no
- [ ] wait for Roger's response to my message sent 2026-05-05 for the error message I got when I tried to create a join with [[content/Example dataset mapping/Strucke Data mapping/Entity physical_samples|Entity physical_samples]] on `lab_no`
