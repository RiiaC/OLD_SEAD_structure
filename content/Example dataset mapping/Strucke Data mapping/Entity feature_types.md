> [!info] The Strucke column `context_type` seems to equate to SEADs `tbl_feature_types`
> Hhowever the ones in the Strucke dataset are in Swedish, while the ones in SEAD are in English. We will need to determine which ones are already in SEAD (what their `feature_type_id`is, or if they need a new one), and if there are any issues with spelling that result in more than one `context_type` in the Strucke that clearly are describing the same type of context (like we see in the species column). 
> I suspect that we will want to preserve the Swedish word, too, in another column (possibly the [[content/Structure of SEAD/Columns/description|description]] column of [[tbl_features]]) but that is a discussion we can have with Phil when he returns.
