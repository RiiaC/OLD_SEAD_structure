> [!info] The "species" column of the Strucke data usually contains the Swedish word for the material dated, which is often a name of a plant or animal. 
> Therefore, this information needs to be mapped to SEAD's list of common names for plants or animals, which, in turn, is linked via `taxon_id` to the corresponding order/family/genus/species name for the plant or animal (to whichever level is appropriate based on the common name)
> 
> Therefore, a necessary part of the mapping process is to: 
> 1. Create a complete list of all of the common names of plants and animals used in this dataset
> 2. ~~Determine the corresponding order/family/genus/species name, as appropriate~~ Determine the corresponding species
> 3. For each of these that is already present in SEAD, determine the corresponding `taxon_id`~~, `genus_id`, `family_id`, and `taxonomic_order_id`~~ (given the way SEAD is set up, matching the `taxon_id`is good enough, and the rest of the matches will propagate from there. However, see [[GitHub SEAD_change_control issue 434]] for notes on places where that propagation may be in error and probably should be fixed)

# First try, mapping "species" to SEAD's `tbl_taxa_common_names` etc.
I prepared a quick first draft of a list of the terms in the "species" column thusly:
1. Use Excel's pivot table function to determine the count of each unique string in the `species` column. The table of the ten most popular is:

| species                         | count      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Tall                            | 2,929      |
| Björk                           | 1,953      |
| Ek                              | 1,736      |
| Hassel                          | 1,649      |
| Al                              | 1,213      |
| Människa                        | 1,160      |
| Gran                            | 1,098      |
| Skalkorn                        | 865        |
| Korn                            | 416        |
| Salix sp.                       | 412        |
| blank                           | 12,061     |
| **total number of data points** | **30,301** |

2. copy the `species` column to a blank spreadsheet
	1. remove duplicates *(29742 duplicates deleted, 560 unique values remain)*
	2. use Excel's text to columns function to break the text to a new column at every slash: / 
	   *(and move the extra column thus created to the other side of the main column, so it won't be over written in the next step)*
	3. break the text to a new column at every parentheses start: (
	    *(and move the extra column thus created to the other side of the main column, so it won't be over written in the next step)*
	4. break the text to a new column at every question mark: ?
	    *(and move the extra column thus created to the other side of the main column, so it won't be over written in the next step. Note: most question marks do not have subsequent text, and show only uncertainty in the data)*
	5. break the text into multiple columns at every comma: ,
	   *(due to time constraints, I then ignored all of the additional columns thus created, and just worked with what was left in the starting column, so as to create a list to work with as quickly as possible)*
	6. remove duplicates again (29932 duplicates deleted, 372 unique values remain), and sort the list alphabetically
	7. skim quickly through the list, deleting:
		1. obvious duplicate terms with a slightly different spelling 
		2. species terms that are already in Latin instead of Swedish
		3. terms that are not species at all (e.g. numbers, (SOL)
3. Send the resulting, partially cleaned, list as a csv file to Johan to be further processed with AI. on a machine with a local copy of SEAD database that the AI can access. Johan used as the prompt for the first attempt:
> I need you to read list.csv and construe/infer the species from each line/string. These are all swedish words and terms for things where there often will be species in the word in one way or another. For example "Aborrskinn" should be inferred to refer to "Aborre" which is a fish (bass). Your job is to infer the species and then figure out: 
> 1. What the swedish common name for it is. 
> 2. what the latin name for it is. Try to figure out the Species, Genus, Family, Order. Some things will be specifiable to a higher degree than other, and some not at all. 
> I want you to write down your findings in a file called output.csv. I also want you to try and match the common names to the common names in the database (tbl_taxa_common_names) . And then also try to match all the latin  names forr species, genus and family. The tables in the database for these are: 
> - tbl_taxa_tree_master (species), 
> - tbl_taxa_tree_families, 
> - tbl_taxa_tree_order 
> So in the output, I want these columns: 
> 1. Original term 
> 2. Common name (inferred) 
> 3. Species 
> 4. Genus 
> 5. Family 
> 6. Common name match 
> 7. Species match 
> 8. Genus match 
> 9. Family match 
> 10. Order match 
> Be meticulous about this task and don't stop until all words are done

Johan shared the result of that first attempt with me. We discussed it, and AI was re-set the task, but this time to include the corresponding SEAD id numbers for each of the taxon/species/etc levels for each of these that already exists in the database. The revised version ran overnight, and got stuck in the process whilst unattended, so it was re-run with OpenAI to create a the document **Strucke-species-openai-output 1.csv**.
# processing the results
The above `species-openai-output 1.csv` document was used to create a spreadsheet, `strucke common names report.xlsx`, using the following workflows:
## workflow to create report, part 1, generating the first draft
- create `Strucke-species-openai-output 1.csv` as described in my notes for the 2026-06-11 common names mapping meeting, and save to a scrap paper document (no changes to the original). Re-arrange the column order to group the columns showing if each level matches with SEAD, the Taxonomic names, and their corresponding SEAD id numbers. This results in a sequence of columns for 
	- Common name DB match
	- Species DB match
	- Genus DB match
	- Family DB match
	- Order DB match
> [!note]+ to look up names or numbers at any of these levels in SEAD, use:
> - https://browser.sead.se/postgrest/tbl_taxa_common_names
> - https://browser.sead.se/postgrest/tbl_taxa_tree_master
> - https://browser.sead.se/postgrest/tbl_taxa_tree_genera
> - https://browser.sead.se/postgrest/tbl_taxa_tree_families
> - https://browser.sead.se/postgrest/tbl_taxa_tree_orders

- for every row in edited output document, compare with the corresponding row of this document, and either
	- If it matches to SEAD, copy-paste the results to the appropriate columns
	- If it is not a SEAD match, but AI could determine taxonomic name(s), copy them over to the appropriate columns of this spreadsheet, and turn the row red to flag it as new. 
	- If it is not a match, and AI did not suggest a taxonomic name, either move the term to the "probably not a species" column, or to the "latin" row (if it looks like a latin term), or turn the row red and leave it where it is (if it is a general common name that needs to be considered for inclusion in SEAD even though it doesn't correspond to a specific taxa (dagdjur, fisk, etc))
	- Note: if there are multiple spellings of the same term in the Strucke data, consolidate them all to the same row, moving the variants to the "similar term/spelling" column, so that this report contains only one row for each term. Usually the AI flags these by putting the same term in the "inferred common name" column, and using the same set of taxonomic names for the full set of variations.
> [!abstract] at regular intervals as I worked I applied the following sort rules:
> - sort by "probably not a species" A - Z
> - then by "original term" by font colour, red on top
> - then by "original term" A - Z
> - then by Latin A-Z

When I was done, the columns looked like this:

| column name            | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| probably not a species | The terms that appear in the species list that probably belong in another column, as they do not appear to be species names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Latin                  | If the term in the species column was already in latin, I moved it here. If it appears to match a common name that is also used, it gets put into the same row as the common name. If the latin term was not included in the input file given to AI it is in red text here, so as to mark which ones still need to be checked for presence in SEAD |
| English common name    | An English translation of the original term (Phil suggested that if we are going to the bother of adding new common names, we could also add the English equivalent)                                                                                                                                                                               |
| original term          | The term, as it appeared in the species list. In cases where there is a list of terms in a single cell (separated by a comma or a slash) they have been broken into one row for each term in the list                                                                                                                                              |
| similar spellings      | Some terms used appear to be misspellings of others in the list. In these cases, they have been consolidated to a single row                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| suggested form         | If a term was a compound word, only one of which was a species, that species common name is listed here. Since SEAD's common names seem to be recorded in lower case, the lower case version of the term is listed here. *Do we wish to edit the term to this version?*                                                                            |
| SEAD common name       | If this term, or a reasonable variant thereof, already exists in SEAD's `tbl_taxa_common_names, it is recorded here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| species                | The species name as suggested by AI, in black text if this species name already exists in SEAD, and in red if it does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| genus                  | The genus name as suggested by AI, in black text if this species name already exists in SEAD, and in red if it does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| family                 | The family name as suggested by AI, in black text if this species name already exists in SEAD, and in red if it does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| order                  | The order name as suggested by AI, in black text if this species name already exists in SEAD, and in red if it does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| taxon_common_name_id   | If this term, or a reasonable variant thereof, already exists in SEAD's `tbl_taxa_common_names`, its corresponding `taxon_common_name_id` is recorded here                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| taxon_id  <br>         | The SEAD `taxon_id` corresponding to the above species. In some cases the AI tagged the taxon as ambiguous, and gave two alternatives, in which case these are in red.                                                                                                                                                                             |

## workflow to create report, part 2, making the draft easier to read
Since the sheet had been sorted as above, I pulled out the various sections to their own sheets and cleaned them up as follows:
### not species
This sheet contains all of the terms that occurs in the `Species` column that are not, in fact a species term. Some of them are a specification of what part of the plant, animal, or thing was dated (ben, kotte, etc.) Others specify the size (litet, stor, etc.)
These terms often occur in conjunction with other terms in the same cell, sometimes as compound words. Therefore, the first column of this sheet contains the root form of the word, the second column gives a count of of the number of cells in the species column of the `c14_master_v08.xlsx` spreadsheet  in which that root appears. The remaining columns contain the various full forms of the word or phrase in which the root word appears. In theory, this information will help with normalisation. 
It is recommended that all of the non-species terms be removed from the species column and put into either a new column, or one of the existing columns, as appropriate, so that the species column contains only species.
#### workflow to get this sheet in the above format
1. take the list of "not species" found in [[Entity common_names#workflow to create report, part 1, generating the first draft|part 1]] above and pull them to their own sheet.
2. for each term do a "find all" for the `species` column of the `c14_master_v08.xlsx` spreadsheet
3. make a note in the second column of this report sheet of the number of occurrences of this term
4. return to the the `c14_master_v08.xlsx` spreadsheet, click on one of the occurrences in the "find all" window, then hit cntrl-A to select all occurrences.
5. close the "find all" window and press cntrl-C to copy them 
6. paste them into an unused corner of a spreadsheet, remove duplicates, and sort the remaining cells containing the root term
7. copy them, and paste them, transposed, into the columns next to the count of the term. 
8. Repeat for all terms of the list, deleting any compound versions of terms that appear elsewhere on the list
### the other sheets 
The other sheets will get their own write-ups when I get far enough along as to create them. In the short term, the other sheet, called "species" still contains:
- the list of species which are present in SEAD with the name recorded in Swedish (black text)
- those species, with Swedish names, which are not present in SEAD (red text)
- those species for which the Latin names were given instead of a Swedish name (its own column)
- and those terms which are general terms for a group of plants or animals (Däggdjur, Fisk, Fågel etc.) (pink text)
