> [!to do] The relevant columns for this dataset relating to site in national grid coordinates are:
> - **northing_3006** 
> - **easting_3006**


> [!warning]  the tbl_site_natgridrefs table in SEAD is currently empty. 
> However, it looks like an appropriate place to record the given northering and easting values in this dataset


- [ ] talk to Phil about this table, and if we want to use it for these columns, or if he has a better solution
- [ ] create a data-derived entity site_natgridrefs
- [ ] add to it a column for `method_id` and figure out which one is appropriate for this data set
- [ ] link this entity to [[content/Example dataset mapping/Strucke Data mapping/Entity site|Entity site]]
