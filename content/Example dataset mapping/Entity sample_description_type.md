Since this is fixed values, I just created these extra columns:

| New Column Name | Source Column                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type_name       | Biological Age                                                            |
| description     | The (infered) age or development stage of the animal whose bone was dated |


> [!to do] decide if you want to change this to a combo of tbl_abundance_modifications and # tbl_modification_types as per Tom's suggestion of 2026-02-19
